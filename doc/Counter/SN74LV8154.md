## Dual 16-BIT binary counter

2V to 5.5V Vcc operation

### Pin configurations

![](SN74LV8154_pin_configurations.png)



Pin 1 - **CLKA** : clock for A counter  
Pin 2 - **CLKB** : clock for B counter  
Pin 3 - **GAL** : first  byte (0 to 255) for 16 bit A counter and for 32 bit AB counter   
Pin 4 - **GAU** : second byte (512 to 65280) for 16 bit A counter and for 32 bit AB counter  
Pin 5 - **GBL** : first byte (0 to 255) for B counter and third byte (65536 to 16711680) for 32 bit AB counter  
Pin 6 - **GBU** : second byte (512 to 65280) for 16 bit B counter and fourth byte (16777216 to 4278190080) for 32 bit AB counter  
Pin 7 - **RCLK** : read clock and save in storage register  
Pin 8 - **RCOA** : Output of counter A, used to realize a 32 bit counter  
Pin 9 - **CLKBEN** : input of counter B, used to realize a 32 bit counter  
Pin 10 - **GND** : Ground  
Pin 11 - **CCLR** : Clear registers  
Pins 12 to 19 - **Y7 to Y0** : Ouputs  
Pin 20 - **Vcc**  

### How to use it as a 32 bit counter

1. Connect RCOA to CLKBEN. Tie them to Vcc ( pull-up)
2. Connect CCLR to Vcc (pull-up)
3. Choose the byte you want to read(GAL, GAU and connect it to GND through a pull-down resistor other bytes have to be connected to Vcc (pull-up)
4. Connect CLKA and CLKB and tie them to Vcc (pull-up)

### How to read state register

Send a positive pulse on RCLK. You can now read the outputs on Y0 to Y7.

### How to reset the counter

Send a negative pulse on CCLR.
