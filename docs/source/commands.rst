Low level commands
==================

Raspardas uses a set of commands to communicate with the ardas.
It is possible to forward such commands through raspardas using a telnet connection using port 10001 or a direct
serial connection to the ardas is also possible but not recommended. Indeed, some of those commands are intercepted by
raspardas and processed before being forwarded to the ardas while other are only known to raspardas and have no effect
when sent directly to an ardas.

Note : Every data sequence send by an ardas is followed by \n\r (LFCR)
However each command end line sent to ardas must be \r (CR)
